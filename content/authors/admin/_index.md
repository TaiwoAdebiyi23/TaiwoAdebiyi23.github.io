## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Houston, working under the guidance of Dr. Ruda Zhang in the Uncertainty Quantification Lab. My research centers on Probabilistic Machine Learning, with a strong focus on Bayesian Optimization and Gaussian Process Modeling. I am dedicated to advancing global optimization strategies, particularly for training foundational models and optimizing hyperparameters. My passion lies in applying my work to create resilient systems, where I am actively involved in developing Digital Twins for civil engineering and leveraging Bayesian Optimization techniques for enhancing Energy Storage Devices.
